      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h3>Exploring New Solutions to Complex Conditions</h3>
      <p>Physical fitness is associated with a range of psychological benefits - it can help prevent problems arising, promote a positive personal development including self awareness and confidence plus boost social skills, it can also aid in the treatment of mental health problems</p>
      <p>Mental health covers a broad range of disorders that affect thinking, mood, feeling, all and any of which have an impact on daily living. Early intervention is critical in young people to help prevent these problems continuing on into adulthood. The preferred and often necessary method of treatment is intervention with prescribed medication. However, this in itself can compound and challenge an individual's ability to perform physical exercise.</p>
      <p>Head4Strength is looking to explore new solutions to these complex conditions by offering gym membership with access to PT’s specialised in fitness & nutrition at significantly lower rates. All aspects of each young person’s situation will be assessed before a program is created. This will include a healthy, affordable diet, combined with suitable physical activity which is effectively structured, repetitive & purposeful. This will undoubtedly increase mental wellbeing & resilience & hopefully, long term, arrest the progression of any current mental or physical illness & possibly even allow for a reduction in medication.</p>
      <p>Our pilot project of aims to help 10 young & vulnerable people living at the Penzance Foyer. They’re a wonderful, enthusiastic  group looked over by an equally  wonderful woman called Jo.  We’re already well underway but we’re always looking for your support, your ideas, your contributions. So get in touch today!</p>
